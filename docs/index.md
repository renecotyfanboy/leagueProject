# What's in this website?

This website is a collection of stuff I did around data science and League of Legends. At this time, it is 
mainly focused on the analysis I did around the (non)-existence of the LoserQ mechanism. As we would say in France, 
this work is "fait avec soin par mes petites mains", but I did my best to get a simili-peer reviewing process by asking 
both friends and strangers to criticize it. Here are the people who contributed to this project :

- [renecotyfanboy](https://www.reddit.com/user/renecotyfanboy/), Simon Dupourqu√© (PhD) in real life : the author of this 
website, and the one who did all the analysis. Currently working in an astrophysic postdoc at 
[IRAP](https://www.irap.omp.eu/) in Toulouse.
