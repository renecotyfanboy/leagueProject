# Conclusions

## What we showed 

To conclude, we showed that the most significant effect we found in our dataset is a weak dependency on the previous 
game outcome. People win $\sim 0.5\%$ more games after a win, and lose $\sim 0.2\%$ more games after a loss. This is
clearly too low to generate long streaks of wins or losses.

## So what is LoserQ ?

- Being placed to high early in the season 
- Coping / confirmation bias https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563223001796
- Under damped MMR system, especially with a "noisy" game and high gains/losses in rank
